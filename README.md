An Extension on top of the Microsoft team foundation server (TFS) service to provides set of services which is not available through TFS service itself.

This is an inprogress project and I'm working on it at the moment. 

Until i'm completing this help file, just Check out the 'Tosan.TFSHelperTest' project, very simple console application to just shows how you can use this extension, actually this is very simple to use and there is nothing complicated about it but if you found any just email me.
